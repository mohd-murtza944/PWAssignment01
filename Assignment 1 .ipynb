    " Answer -   1. Easy When we say the word ‘easy’, we mean it in different contexts.\n",
    "            a. Easy to Code\n",
    "            Python is very easy to code as compared to other popular languages like Java and C++.Anyone can learn Basic Python               syntax in just a few hours. Thus, it is programmer-friendly.\n",
    "            b. Easy to Read\n",
    "            Being a high-level language, Python code is quite like English. Looking at it, you can tell what the code is                     supposed to do.Also, since it is dynamically-typed, it mandates indentation. This aids readability.\n",
    "            2. Expressive\n",
    "           Suppose we have two languages A and B, and all programs that can be made in A can be made in B using local                      transformations.\n",
    "            However, there are some programs that can be made in B, but not in A, using local transformations. Then, B is said               to be more expressive than A.\n",
    "            Python provides us with a myriad of constructs that help us focus on the solution rather than on the syntax.\n",
    "            This is one of the outstanding python features that tell you why you should learn Python.\n",
    "            3. Free and Open-Source\n",
    "            Firstly, Python is freely available. You can download it from the Python Official Website.\n",
    "            Secondly, it is open-source. This means that its source code is available to the public. You can download it, change             it, use it, and distribute it.\n",
    "            4. High-Level\n",
    "            Python is a high-level language. This means that as programmers, we don’t need to remember the system architecture.\n",
    "            Also, we need not manage memory. This makes it more programmer-friendly and is one of the key python features\n",
    "            5. Portable\n",
    "            Let’s assume you’ve written a Python code for your Windows machine. Now, if you want to run it on a Mac, you don’t               need to make changes to it for the same . In other words, you can take one code and run it on any machine. This                 makes Python a portable language.However, you must avoid any system-dependent features in this case.\n",
    "            6. Interpreted\n",
    "            If you’re familiar with any languages like C++ or Java, you must first compile it, and then run it. But in Python,               there is no need to compile it.Internally, its source code is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.\n",
    "            So, all you need to do is to run your Python code without worrying about linking to libraries, and a few other                   things.By interpreted, we mean the source code is executed line by line, and not all at once. Because of this, it is             easier to debug your code.Also, interpreting makes it just slightly slower than Java, but that does not matter                   compared to the benefits it offers.\n",
    "            7. Object-Oriented\n",
    "            A programming language that can model the real world is said to be object-oriented. It focuses on objects and                   combines data and functions.Contrarily, a procedure-oriented language revolves around functions, which are code that             can be reused.Python supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming which is one of the key python              features.It also supports multiple inheritance, unlike Java.A class is a blueprint for such an object. It is an                  abstract data type and holds no values.\n",
    "            8. Extensible\n",
    "            If needed, you can write some of your Python code in other languages like C++.\n",
    "            This makes Python an extensible language, meaning that it can be extended to other languages.\n",
    "            9. Embeddable\n",
    "            We just saw that we can put code in other languages in our Python source code.However, it is also possible to put               our Python code in a source code in a different language like C++.This allows us to integrate scripting capabilities             into our program of the other language.\n",
    "            10. Large Standard Library\n",
    "          Python downloads with a large library that you can use so you don’t have to write your own code for every single                 thing.There are libraries for regular expressions, documentation-generation, unit-testing, web browsers, threading,             databases, CGI, email, image manipulation, and a lot of other functionality\n",

    "Answer - Immutable Objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. \n",
    "In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created. \n",
    "Example 1: In this example, we will take a tuple and try to modify its value at a particular index and print it. \n",

    "capability of an object to be changed or modified after its creation.In Python, lists are a widely used data structure that \n",

    "Example 1: Add and Remove items from a list in Python\n",
    "In this example, we will take a Python List object and try to modify its value using the index. A list in Python is mutable, \n",

    "Lists provide methods such as append(),insert(),extend(),remove() and pop().\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable vs Immutable -\n",
    "1 -Mutable and immutable objects are handled differently in Python. Immutable objects are quicker to access and \n",
    "are expensive to change because it involves the creation of a copy. Whereas mutable objects are easy to change.\n",
    "2 - The use of mutable objects is recommended when there is a need to change the size or content of the object.\n",
    "3 - Exception: However, there is an exception in immutability as well. We know that a tuple in Python is immutable. \n",
    "    But the tuple consists of a sequence of names with unchangeable bindings to objects. Consider a tuple\n",
    "4 - The tuple consists of a string and a list. Strings are immutable so we can’t change their value.\n",
    "But the contents of the list can change. The tuple itself isn’t mutable but contains items that are mutable. \n",
    "As a rule of thumb, generally, Primitive-like types are probably immutable, and Customized Container-like types are \n",
    "mostly mutable."
